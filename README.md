## Hi there, I'm Tori 👋
I joke that I'm a 'full stack' data analyst because I've done it all! Okay, maybe not everything but 'full stack' is a great description of my experience so far. I started as an intern with my current employer and was hired as a Data Analyst I after my internship was over. In this role, I honed in my data visualization skills in Power BI to make some impactful reports still used throughout the company. I moved into a Data Analyst II role recently, where I've enjoyed developing skills on the ETL and data engineering side of things. I love the diversity this experience has brought to my career, and I enjoy being able to take a project start to finish, from ETL to visualization and everything in between.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the beast that is SAP in preparation for converting our Power BI reports over to SAP Analytics Cloud
