## Hi there, I'm Tori Snow 👋
I joke that I'm a 'full stack' data analyst because I've done it all! Okay, well maybe not everything but that is a great description of my experience so far in my career. Starting as a intern at my current company, I've worked my way up to a Data Analyst I, where I honed in my Power BI skills to make some impactful reports used throughout the company, and then to Data Analyst II, where I've enjoyed developing skills in the ETL and data engineering field.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on improving our models for projecting sales based on demand forecasts, historical run rates, and current inventory levels internally and externally.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the beast that is SAP in preparation for the transition to that software
